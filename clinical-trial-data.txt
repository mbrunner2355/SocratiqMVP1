SocratIQ Clinical Trial Protocol CT-BNT327-002

Study Title: Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of BNT-327 in Patients with EGFR T790M-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer

Principal Investigator: Dr. Sarah Chen, MD Anderson Cancer Center
Co-Principal Investigator: Dr. Michael Rodriguez, UCLA Medical Center

Study Sponsor: Pfizer Inc.
Clinical Research Organization: ICON Clinical Research
Data Safety Monitoring Board Chair: Dr. James Wilson, Johns Hopkins Hospital

Study Overview:
This multicenter Phase III trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of BNT-327 compared to standard of care in 450 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR T790M mutations.

Key Inclusion Criteria:
- Age â‰¥18 years
- Histologically confirmed NSCLC with EGFR T790M mutation
- Progressive disease following first-line EGFR TKI therapy
- ECOG performance status 0-2
- Adequate organ function

Primary Endpoint:
Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR)

Secondary Endpoints:
- Overall survival (OS)
- Objective response rate (ORR) 
- Duration of response (DOR)
- Safety and tolerability
- Quality of life measures (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-LC13)

Study Sites:
1. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center - Dr. Lisa Patel (Target: 45 patients)
2. MD Anderson Cancer Center - Dr. Sarah Chen (Target: 60 patients) 
3. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute - Dr. Robert Kim (Target: 35 patients)
4. Mayo Clinic Rochester - Dr. Jennifer Lee (Target: 40 patients)
5. UCLA Medical Center - Dr. Michael Rodriguez (Target: 50 patients)
6. Cleveland Clinic - Dr. David Thompson (Target: 35 patients)
7. Stanford Cancer Institute - Dr. Maria Gonzalez (Target: 30 patients)
8. University of Chicago Medicine - Dr. Andrew Park (Target: 25 patients)
9. Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center - Dr. Susan Miller (Target: 35 patients)
10. Seattle Cancer Care Alliance - Dr. Kevin Zhang (Target: 40 patients)

Regulatory Status:
- FDA IND Number: 145,789
- IRB Approvals: Obtained from all participating sites
- Clinical Trial Registration: NCT05234567
- EMA Clinical Trial Application: Submitted March 2024

Statistical Considerations:
Sample size of 450 patients provides 85% power to detect hazard ratio of 0.65 for PFS, assuming median PFS of 8 months in control arm and 12.3 months in BNT-327 arm, with two-sided alpha of 0.05.

Safety Monitoring:
Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety data every 3 months. Stopping rules include:
- Grade 4 treatment-related AEs in >15% of patients
- Treatment-related mortality rate >5%
- Futility analysis at 50% information fraction

Key Personnel:
- Study Director: Dr. Patricia Adams, Pfizer Global R&D
- Biostatistician: Dr. Thomas Chen, Pfizer Statistics
- Medical Monitor: Dr. Rachel Johnson, Pfizer Oncology
- Clinical Operations Manager: Maria Santos, ICON Clinical
- Pharmacovigilance Lead: Dr. Alan Cooper, Pfizer Safety
