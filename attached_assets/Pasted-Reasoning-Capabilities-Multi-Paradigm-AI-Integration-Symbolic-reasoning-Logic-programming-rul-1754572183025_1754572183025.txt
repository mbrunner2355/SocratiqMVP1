Reasoning Sessions & Execution Architecture
Each SophieLogic™ reasoning cycle runs as a self-contained session—triggered by data signals, agent requests, or user prompts. Within each session, Sophie maintains a short-term working memory that includes agent state, metrics in play, and scenario variables. Context is drawn from long-term corpora and the SocratIQ Mesh™, ensuring continuity with past decisions and data lineage.
SophieLogic™ dynamically assembles reasoning workflows by composing modular agents (PatternDetectionAgents, ScenarioAgents, DecisionEngineAgents), selecting them based on input data type, domain, and risk class. These agents then invoke appropriate models—ranging from transformers to simulators—based on reasoning task and policy constraints.
Each completed reasoning cycle produces a TraceUnit™—a structured, immutable record of:
•	A Pattern detected in metrics or documents
•	A Scenario modeled or simulated by one or more reasoning engines
•	A Recommendation surfaced with rationale and confidence score
TraceUnits™ are automatically captured in SocratIQ Trace™ with full agent, model, data, and override lineage—ensuring every decision can be audited, defended, or improved.
