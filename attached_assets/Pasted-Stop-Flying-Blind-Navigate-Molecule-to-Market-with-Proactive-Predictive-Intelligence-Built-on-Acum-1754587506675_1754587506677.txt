Core Purpose
Why SocratIQ™ Exists
Today’s life-science development and commercialization remain siloed, reactive and slow—delaying therapies not for lack of efficacy, but because post-discovery data and decision-flows are fractured. Designed for biotech, pharma, CDMOs and investors, SocratIQ™ unifies every piece of translational-development, regulatory, financial and operational data, and automates proactive, cross-functional orchestration so organizations move from guesswork to data-driven precision, from delay to velocity, and from fragmentation to seamless execution.

Vision
Every life-science organization will navigate commercialization with crystal-clear, predictive confidence—delivering the right therapies to patients, faster.

How It Works
Powered by the SocratIQ™ Platform and orchestrated by SophieLogic™, SocratIQ™ turns post-discovery data chaos into proactive, end-to-end commercialization intelligence you can trust and act on.
1.	Ingest & Fuse
All structured (EHR, LIMS, IoT telemetry, CTMS) and unstructured (PDFs, slide decks, audio/video, free-text) sources are ingested via hybrid pipelines into a unified semantic store—normalizing terms against public (MeSH, SNOMED, ICD) and proprietary ontologies.
2.	Predict & Reason
Graph Neural Networks traverse the Cortex mesh, transformer ensembles extract domain insights, Bayesian risk engines score outcomes, and counterfactual simulators explore “what-if” scenarios—surfacing actionable recommendations with confidence scores.
3.	Automate & Audit
SophieLogic™ orchestrates next-best actions across licensed modules—either recommending or autonomously executing tasks. Every data transformation, decision rationale and user override is recorded in an immutable, GxP-compliant audit trail via Trace™.
