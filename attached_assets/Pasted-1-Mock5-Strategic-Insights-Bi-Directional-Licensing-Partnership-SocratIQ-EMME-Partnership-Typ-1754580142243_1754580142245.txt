1. Mock5 Strategic Insights – Bi-Directional Licensing Partnership (SocratIQ EMME™)
Partnership Type: Strategic Licensing & Co-Development
Modules: EMME Connect, EMME Engage, EMME Health
Mock5 and SocratIQ have established a flagship bi-directional partnership. SocratIQ licenses the EMME Connect commercialization planning framework from Mock5 and integrates it into the core platform. In turn, Mock5 licenses the SocratIQ Platform to power its own branded offerings — EMME Engage (go-to-market execution) and EMME Health (health equity specialization).
Mock5 has the option to spin out one or more NewCos to house these offerings. SocratIQ retains rights to the EMME Connect framework and provides infrastructure for branded or white-labeled deployments (“Powered by SocratIQ”).
Revenue Model & Strategic Opportunity:
•	SocratIQ receives revenue share from platform-enabled services (Engage/Health) and annual platform licensing fees
•	Mock5 monetizes its methodologies and expands its service delivery
•	5+ pharmaceutical clients are already being actively pursued, validating the model and creating a near-term growth path
2. Large Construction Firm (SocratIQ Build™) - Pilot to Production Construction Founder-Initiated NewCo – 
Partnership Type: Customer-Initiated Platform Partnership with NewCo Formation
Module: SocratIQ Build™ (Construction Optimization & Risk Intelligence)
This partnership originated from a customer pilot with the owner of a leading commercial construction firm. The pilot successfully applied SocratIQ Build™ across $500M+ in infrastructure and healthcare projects, with integrations to Procore and Primavera P6. Results included improved timeline coordination, risk identification, and subcontractor communication.
During the pilot, the firm’s owner initiated plans to launch a NewCo focused on AI-powered construction intelligence. SocratIQ is engaged in active discussions around licensing, co-packaging, and platform alignment to support this venture.
This model highlights SocratIQ’s ability to evolve customer engagements into strategic platform relationships, enabling entrepreneurial growth from within industry ecosystems.
Revenue Model & Strategic Opportunity:
•	SocratIQ is expected to license the core platform to the NewCo under a multi-year agreement
•	White-labeled or co-branded versions of SocratIQ Build™ may be deployed across the firm’s internal projects and broader industry network
•	The construction firm’s IT subsidiary presents a potential channel partner to expand reach
•	Monetization pathways may include annual licensing, onboarding services, and AI-enabled project analytics
•	The evolving structure demonstrates how customer success can lead to platform-level business formation — validating SocratIQ’s flexibility to serve as the intelligence engine behind industry-specific ventures
