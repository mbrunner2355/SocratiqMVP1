# AWS Cognito Authentication Flow Fix

## The Issue
Your authentication is failing because the required authentication flows are not enabled in your AWS Cognito User Pool app client.

## Exact Steps to Fix:

### 1. Access AWS Cognito Console
- Go to AWS Console → Amazon Cognito
- Select your User Pool: `us-east-1_FBeAewbir`

### 2. Configure App Client
- Click "App integration" tab
- Find your app client (should show Client ID: `20in1ee6g6j5ql9pfcv3avbn2a`)
- Click on the app client name

### 3. Edit Authentication Flows
- Scroll to "Authentication flows" section
- Click "Edit"
- Enable these authentication flows:
  - ✅ **ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH** (Required for your login)
  - ✅ **ALLOW_REFRESH_TOKEN_AUTH** (Required for token refresh)
  - ✅ **ALLOW_USER_SRP_AUTH** (Recommended for security)

### 4. Save Changes
- Click "Save changes"
- Changes take effect immediately

## Why This Fixes the Problem

Your authentication code uses `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow, but this flow is disabled by default in new Cognito app clients. Enabling `ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` allows your application to authenticate users with username/password directly.

## Test After Fix

1. Try logging in at your Replit URL: https://1c8ab96d-1378-4464-9042-df235b421259-00-2oytctg4zbtla.picard.replit.dev
2. The Cognito login form should work without errors
3. Users should be able to sign up and sign in successfully

## For AWS Amplify Deployment

The same authentication flows need to be enabled for your production deployment to work. Once you fix this in Cognito, both your Replit development environment and AWS Amplify production will work correctly.

## Alternative Solution

If you can't modify the Cognito settings, you can create a new app client:
1. In Cognito → App integration → Create app client
2. Choose "Public client" (no client secret needed)
3. Enable the authentication flows above
4. Update your environment variables with the new Client ID
